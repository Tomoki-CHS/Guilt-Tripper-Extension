# Guilt-Tripper-Extension
Pretty simple chrome extension that guilt trips you into getting productive! By showing your time on Youtube and number of Shorts watched, you will eventually stop watching, purely from guilt!!

If you keep the page open and come back, the text won't reset. If anything is buggy, please refresh the page.

This was also made for the BrowserBuddy submission! 

Text shows up on https://youtube.com/shorts/* pages.
